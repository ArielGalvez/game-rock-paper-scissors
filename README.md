## My process

- Layout the mockups using mobile fist
- Adap the components to desktop view using media-queries
- Layout the different game status
- Add game engine to make computer play
- Create a Store
- Persist Store with cache
- Build manually and deploy to netlify
- Describe solution

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - programming languaje
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [CSS](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles `still pure CSS`

### What I learned

This time I learned vite with react, I heard about another tool and wanted to test it, so yes is fast.
I also know redux toolkit but use for this project will be over kill, so another option will be context but I test zustand.
For the cache it was easy because zustand already has a middleware easy to use.
Something that I still feel proud is that you won't find `any` in the whole project.
The animations were made whitout libraries as well.

### Continued development

I would like to have another complex design to implement, on my free time as part of my hoobies I like implement figma designs using html+css.
Maybe in the future I will complete the `Bonus`.
